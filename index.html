        <h1> Isaac: About Myself </h1>
        
        <p class="intro"> I'm Isaac! I'm 26 years old, married for two years, and a VCD major here at EWU. I'll be graduating in the spring and am pumped to see where I end up next. Currently I'm working at Dutch Bros Coffee in downtown Spokane, and am a manager/trainer. I've made coffee for a really long time, but life is still good. I went back to school because I realized that if I'm not being creative in some sort of way then I get pretty burnt out on life. I'm not sure where design is going to take me, but I'm eager to try new things and find my niche. Currently my favorite creative outlets are working on/customizing/fixing up old motorcyles, and playing music at church. As long as I'm making/creating something I'm usually pretty stoked on it.
